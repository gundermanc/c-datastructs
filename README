INTRODUCTION:
This package compiles to a C static library containing a few common data
structures, including a Stack, a tail cached Linked List, a dynamically
expanding string buffer, and a HashTable.

All of these data structures can store the same common type: DSValue,
a union defined in include/build_config.h. By commenting out preprocessor
definitions, a developer can define how large DSValue will be, and what
kind of primitive data types can be stored in it.

BUILDING:
This build requires GCC and GNU make. Run 'make' or 'make library' to 
build the static library which is out put to the main directory and is
named lib.a. For your convenience, a test_app.c file is included as well
which can be used to test the structures and get your bearings. This can
be build with 'make testapp'. 

DOCUMENTATION:
I am terribly lazy, so all documentation is in the form of comments in
the C files. Most of it is pretty self explanitory.
