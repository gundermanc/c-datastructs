INTRODUCTION:
This package compiles to a C static library containing a few common data
structures, including a Stack, a tail cached Linked List, a dynamically
expanding string buffer, and a dynamically resizing HashTable.

DATASTRUCTURES:
ht.c  : Dynamically expanding C hashtable.
ll.c  : Tail Cached Linked list. Supports iterating and appending.
stk.c : Array stack. Supports peek and pop.
sb.c  : Dynamically expanding String "rope" buffer.

All of these data structures can store the same common type: DSValue,
a union defined in include/build_config.h. By commenting out preprocessor
definitions, a developer can define how large DSValue will be, and what
kind of primitive data types can be stored in it. Tweak this value to your
heart's content to optimize these data structures for your particular
application.

BUILDING:
This build requires GCC and GNU make. Run 'make' or 'make library' to 
build the static library which is out put to the main directory and is
named lib.a. For your convenience, a test_app.c file is included as well
which can be used to test the structures and get your bearings. This can
be build with 'make testapp'.

DOCUMENTATION:
I am terribly lazy, so most documentation is in the form of comments in
the C files. Most of it is pretty self explanatory. Each C file contains
one data structure. It is all implemented in C89 code, except for the single
line comments, which I have yet to convert to to C comments, rather than C++
ones.

To use any of the libraries, import their headers from the include directory
and link to the static library. You should then be able to create any of the
structures using **_new() function, where ** is the file name of the structure.

For additional operations, see the comments in the source files. They are
well commented and reable. :)

BUGS:
Most of the code is fairly mature and bug free. The exception to this is the
hashtable, which is mostly complete, except for the ht_iter_next() method,
which has several memory errors where pointers are freed and then accessed
again. This is on the To Fix list for this Friday.

MEMORY ERRORS:
None, except in HashTable. Do not use hashtable until code has matured in release
1.1. Checked with Valgrind.
